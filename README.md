**_Stepper motor controller that rotate brass rods depends on the signal magnitude from WiFi devices and satellites on the sky. This code allows the esp32 board to scan the existence of WiFi routers, and the location of satellites that are tracked based on the current GPS position of the device. Then, it calculates the number of sources which emit signals and magnitudes of those signal from the sources. Lastly, the device converts the number of sources and magnitude of signals to the rotation value of the stepper motor for the dowsing rod._**

## Introduction

The project device has a flower-shaped antenna and a simple radio circuit. The antenna on the front receives radio waves around the device, like the recognition organ of a living organism. The detected signal passes through a radio circuit and is converted into a sound that audiences can hear. Through this signal, the audiences can recognize the footprints of the gigantic technological civilization that always exists around us.

The ecological or post-anthropocene perspective starts from awareness of our current situation. One of the various artificial traces created by humans is radio waves. It creates so many waves, so we can tell that we live in the radio waves civilization. By creating a device that is sonifying this huge ecological footprint, we can recognize the shock that is not captured by our senses.

## Interaction diagram
This apparatus considers data collection activity from the stacks of networks as a creepy gaze from the hyperobject in the form of electromagnetic pulses and represents its magnitude as a rotation of two brass rod. The more the device detects the density of artificial signals nearby, the stronger the gaze it represents. Thus, the device make the brass rod rotate further based on the magnitude of the signal.
